# First Duplicate Value

**_Given an array bw `1` and `n`(inclusive), where `n` is the length of the array, write a function that returns the first integer that appears more than once(when the array is read from left to right)_**

In other words, out of all the integers that might occur in the input array, your function should return the one whose first duplicate value that has the minimum inde.

If no integer appears more than once, function returns `-1`

`Note` You're allowed to mutate the input array

array = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4]
