# Spiral Traverse

**_Write a function that takes in an `m x n` 2-D array(that can be square shaped when m==n) and returns a 1-D array of all the elements in spiral order._**

Spiral order starts at the top left of the 2-D array, goes to the right, and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited.

Sample Input

```go
array = [
    [1,  2,  3,  4],
    [12, 13, 14, 5],
    [11, 16, 15, 6],
    [10,  9,  8, 7]
]
```

Sample Output

```go
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
```
