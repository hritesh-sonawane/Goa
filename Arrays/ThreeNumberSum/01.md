# Three Number Sum

- **_Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum._**

- **_The function should fnd all triplets in the array that sum upto the target sum & return a 2-D array of all these triplets_**

- **_The numbers in each triplet should be ordered in ascending order, and the triplets should themselves be ordered in ascending order with respect to the numbers they hold_**

- **_If no 3 numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array._**

Sample Input

```json
array = [12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5, -8, 6]
targetSum = 0
```

Sample Output

```json
[
  [-8, 2, 6],
  [-8, 3, 5],
  [-6, 1, 5]
]
```
