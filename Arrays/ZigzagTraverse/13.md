# Zigzag Traverse

Write a function that takes in an `n x m` 2D array(that can be square-shaped when n == m) and returns a 1D array of all the array's elements in zigzag order.

Zigzag order starts at the top left corner of the 2D array, goes down by one element, and proceeds in a zigzag pattern all the way to the bottom corner.

Sample Input

```go
array = [
    [01, 03, 04, 10],
    [02, 05, 09, 11],
    [06, 08, 12, 15],
    [07, 13, 14, 16],
]
```

Sample Output

```go
[01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
```
