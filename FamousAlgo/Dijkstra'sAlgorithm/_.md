# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Given an integer `start` and a list `edges` of pairs of integers.

The list is what's called an adjacency list, and it represents a graph.

Write a function that computes the lengths of the shortest path between `start` and all of the other vertices in the graph and returns them in an array.
Each index `i` in the output array should represent the length of the shortest path between `start` and the vertex `i`. If no path is found from `start` to vertex `i`, then `output[i]` should be `-1`.

Sample Input

```go
start = 0
edges = [
    [[1, 7]],
    [[2, 6], [3, 20], [4, 3]],
    [[3, 4]],
    [[4, 2]],
    [],
    [],
]
```

Sample Output

```go
[0, 7, 13, 27, 10, -1]
```
