# River Sizes

Given a 2D array(matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only `0`s and `1`s. Ecah `0` represents land, and each `1` represents part of a river. A river consist of any number of `1`s that are either horizontallly or vertically adjacent(not diagonally). The number of adjacent `1`s forming a river determine its size.

`Note` that a river can twist, i.e. it doesn't have to be a straight vertical line or a straight horizontal line; it can be `L-shaped`, for example.

Write a function that returns an array of all sizes of all rivers represented in the input matrix. The size doesn't need to be in any particular order.

Sample Input

```go
matrix = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
  ]
```

Sample Output

```go
[1, 2, 2, 2, 5] //Numbers could be ordered differently
```
