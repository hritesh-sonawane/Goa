# Tandem Bicycle

A tandem bicycle is a bicycle that is operated by 2 people. Both the people pedal the bicycle at the same time, but the person that pedals faster dictates the speed of the bicycle.

`tandemSpeed = max(speedA, speedB)`

**_Write a function that returns the maximum possible total speed or the minimum possible total speed of all the tandem bicycles based on the input parameter `fastest = true/false` respectively._**

`[1, 4], [5, 3] = 5 + 4 = 9`

Sample Input

```go
redShirtSpeeds = [5, 5, 3, 9, 2],
blueShirtSpeeds = [3, 6, 7, 2, 1],
fastest = true
```

Sample Output

```go
32   // 9+7+6+5+5
```
