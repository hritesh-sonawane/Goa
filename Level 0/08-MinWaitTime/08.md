# Minimum Waiting Time

Given a non-empty array of positive integers representing the amounts of time that specific queries take to execute. Only one query can be executed at a time, but the queries can be executed in any order.

A query's `waiting time` is defined as the amount of time that it must wait before its execution starts. In other words, if a query is executed second, then its waiting time is the sum of the durations of the first 2 queries.

**_Write a function that returns the minimum amount of total waiting time for all of the queries.
egs: [1, 4, 5]
order of execution => [5, 1, 4]
total waiting time => (0) + (5) + (5 + 1) = 11_**

`We can mutate the array`

Sample Input

```go
queries = [3, 2, 1, 2, 6]   //[1, 2, 2, 3, 6]
```

Sample Output

```go
17
```
