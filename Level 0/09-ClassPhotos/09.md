# Class Photos

- Class has even number of students.
- Students wear `red` or `blue` shirts.(Half red half blue)
- Each row should contain the same number of students and should adhere to following guidelines:

1. All students wearing red shirts must be in same row
2. All students wearing blue shirts must be in same row
3. Each student in the back row must be strictly taller than the student directly in front of them in the front row

**_Given 2 input arrays: 1 containing the heights of all the students with red shirts and another one containing the heights of all the students with blue shirts.
These arrays will always have the same length, and each height will be a positive integer.
Write a function that returns whether or not a class photo that follows the stated guidelines can be taken._**

`Note` Assume each class has at least 2 students.

Sample Input

```go
redHeights = [5, 8, 1, 3, 4]
blueHeights = [6, 9, 2, 4, 5]
```

Sample Output

```go
true
```
