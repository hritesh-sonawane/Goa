# Ceaser Cipher Encryptor

**_Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by `k` positions in the alphabet, where `k` is the key._**

`Note` that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter `z` shifted by 1 returns `a`.

Sample Input

```go
string = "xyz"
key = 2
```

Sample Output

```go
"zab"
```
