# Smallest Difference

**_Write a function that takes in 2 non-empty arrays of integers, finds the pair of numbers(one from each array), whose absolute difference is closest to zero, and returns an array containing these 2 numbers, with the number from the first array in first position._**

`Note` Absolute difference of 2 integers is the distance between them on the real number line. egs: absolute difference bw -5 and 5 is 10.

You can assume that there will only be one pair of numbers with the smallest difference.

Sample Input

```json
arr1 = [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3]
arr2 = [26, 134, 135, 15, 17]
```

Sample Output

```json
[28, 26]
```
