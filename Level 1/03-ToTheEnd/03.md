# Move element to the end

**_Given an array of integers and an integer, write a function that moves all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns the array._**

The function should perform this in place(i.e. it should mutate the input array) and doesn't need to maintain the order of other integers.

Sample Input

```json
array = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]
toMove = 2
```

Sample Output

```json
[1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```
