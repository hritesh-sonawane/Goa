# Monotonic Array

**_Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic._**

An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.

Non-increasing/decreasing elements aren't necessarily exclusively decreasing/increasing, they simply don't increase/decrease.

`Note` Empty arrays and arrays of one element are monotonic.

Sample Input

```json
array = [-1, -5, -10, -10, -1102, -9001]
```

Sample Output

```json
true
```
