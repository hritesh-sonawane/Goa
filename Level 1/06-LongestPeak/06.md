# Longest Peak

**_Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the length of the longest peak in the array._**

A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly increasing until they reach a tip(highest value in the peak), at which point they become strictly decreasing. At least 3 integers are required to form a peak.

Sample Input

```go
array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]
```

Sample Output

```go
6 // 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3
```
