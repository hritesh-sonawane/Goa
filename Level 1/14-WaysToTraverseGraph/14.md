# Number of Ways to Traverse Graph

Given 2 positive integers representing the width and height of a grid-shaped, rectangular graph. Write a function that returns the number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the graph when starting at the top left corner. Each move yo make must either go down or right. You cannot move up or left in the graph.

Given the graph illustrated below, with `width = 2` and `height = 3`, there are 3 ways ro reach the bottom right corner when starting at the top left corner.

```go
 _ _
|_|_|
|_|_|
|_|_|
```

Note that `width*height >= 2`

Sample Input

```go
width = 4
height = 3
```

Sample Output

```go
10
```
