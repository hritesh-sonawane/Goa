# Single Cycle Check

Given an array of integers where each integer represents a jump of its value in the array. For instance, the integer `2` represents a jump of two indices forward in the array; the integer `-3` represents a jump pf 3 indices backward in the array.

If a jump spills past the array's bounds, it wraps over to the other side.

Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether the jumps in the array form a single cycle. A single cycle occurs if, starting at any index in the array and following the jumps, every element in the array is visited exactly once before landing on the starting index
.

Sample Input

```go
array = [2, 3, 1, -4, -4, 2]
```

Sample Output

```go
true
```
