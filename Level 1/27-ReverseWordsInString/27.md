# Reverse Words In String

Write function that takes in a string of words separated by 1 or more whitespaces and returns a string that has these words in reverse order. For egs, given the string `"tim is great"`, your function should return `"great is tim"`.

For this problem, a word can contaion special characters, punctuations, and numbers. The words in the string will be separated by one or more whitespaces, and the reversed string must contain the same whitespaces as the original string. `"whitespaces____4"` would return `"4___whitespaces"`.

Note that you're not allowed to use any built-in `split` or `reverse` methods/functions. You can yse `join` method/function.

Also note that the input string isn't guaranteed to always contain words.

Sample Input

```go
string = "Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen"
```

Sample Output

```go
"Targaryen House of Stormborn Daenerys"
```
