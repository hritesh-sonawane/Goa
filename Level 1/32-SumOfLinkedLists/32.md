# Sum of Linked Lists

Given 2 linked lists of potentially unequal length. Each linked list represents a non-negative integer, where each node in the linked list is a digit of that integer, and the first node in each linked list always represents the least significant digit of that integer. Write a function that returns the head of a new linked list that represents the sum of the integers represented by the two input linked list.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list or to `None`/`null` if it's the tail of the list. The `value` of each `LinkedList` node is always in the range of `0-9`.

Note: Your function must create and return a new Linked List, and you're not allowed to modify either of the input linked lists.

Sample Input

```go
linkedList1 = 2 -> 4 -> 7 -> 1
linkedList2 = 9 -> 4 -> 5
```

Sample Output

```go
1 -> 9 -> 2 -> 2
// LL1: 1742
// LL2: 549
// 1742 + 549 = 2291
```
