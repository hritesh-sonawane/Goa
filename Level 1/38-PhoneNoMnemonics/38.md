# Phone Number Mnemonics

The keypad of our mobile phone is like this:

```go
 1     2     3
      abc   def

 4     5     6
ghi   jkl   mno

 7     8     9
pqrs  tuv  wxyz

       0
```

`8464747328` can be written as `timisgreat`
`2` can represent 3 different letters `a, b, c`

Given a stringified phone number of any non-zero length, write a function that returns all mnemonics for this phone number, in any order.

Sample Input

```go
phoneNumber = "1905"
```

Sample Output

```go
[
    "1w0j",
    "1w0k",
    "1w0l",
    "1w0j",
    "1x0k",
    "1x0l",
    "1x0j",
    "1y0j",
    "1y0k",
    "1y0l",
    "1z0j",
    "1z0k",
    "1z0l",
]
```
