# Staircase Traversal

Given 2 positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the maximum number of steps that you can advance up the staircase at a time. Write a function that returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.

For example, if you were given a staircase of `height = 3` and `maxSteps = 2` you could climb the staircase in 3 ways. `1-1-1`, `1-2` or `2-1`.

Note that `maxSteps <= height` is always true.

Sample Input

```go
height = 4
maxSteps = 2
```

Sample Output

```go
5
```
