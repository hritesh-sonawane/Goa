# Find Loop

Write a function that takes in the head of a Single Linked List that contains a loop(in other words, the list's tail node points to some node in the list instead of `None`/`null`). The function should return the node (the actual node-not just its value) from which the loop originates in constant space.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list.

Sample Input

```json
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6   // head node with value 0
                           ^         v
                           9 <- 8 <- 7
```

Sample Output

```json
4 -> 5 -> 6   // node with value 4
^         v
9 <- 8 <- 7
```
