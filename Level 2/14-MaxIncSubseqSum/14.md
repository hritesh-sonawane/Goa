# Max Increasing Subsequence Sum

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns the greatest sum that can be generated from a strictly-increasing sunsequence in the array as well as an array of the numbers in that sunsequence.

A subsequnece of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers `[1, 3, 4]` form a subsequence of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and so do the numbers `[2, 4]`. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequneces of the array.

You can assume that there will be only one increasing subsequnece with the greatest sum.

Sample Input

```go
array = [10, 70, 20, 30, 50, 11, 30]
```

Sample Output

```go
[110, [10, 20, 30, 50]]
```
