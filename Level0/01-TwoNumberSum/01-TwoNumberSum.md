# Two Number Sum

- **_Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum._**

- **_If any 2 numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order._**

- **_If no 2 numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array._**

- **_You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum._**

**Note**: The target sum has to be obtained by summing 2 different integers in the array;
can't add a single integer to itself.

Sample Input

```json
array = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6]
targetSum = 10
```

Sample Output

```json
[-1, 11] // or in reverse order
```
