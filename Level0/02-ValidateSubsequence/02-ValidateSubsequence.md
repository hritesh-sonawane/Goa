# Validate Subsequence

- **_Given 2 non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the 2nd array is a subsequence of the first one._**

- **_[1, 3, 4] & [2, 4] are egs of subsequence of [1, 2, 3, 4]_**

**Note**: A single number in an array and the array itself are both valid & subsequences of the array.

Sample Input

```json
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
```

Sample Output

```json
true
```
