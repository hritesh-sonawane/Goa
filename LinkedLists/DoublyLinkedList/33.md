# Doubly Linked List Construction

Write a `DoublyLinkedList` class that has a `head` and a `tail`, both of which point to either a `Node` or `None`/`null`. The class should support the following:

- Setting head and tail of the linked list
- Inserting nodes before and after other nodes as well as at given positions(position of head node is `1`)
- Removing given nodes and removing nodes with given values
- Searching for nodes with given values

Each `Node` has an integer `value` as well as a `prev` and a `next` node, both of which can point to either another node or `None`/`null`.

Sample Usage

```go
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 //existing ll
// some stand-alone nodes: 3, 3, 6
setHead(4): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 5
setTail(6): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 5 <-> 6
insertBefore(6, 3): 4 <-> 1 <-> 2 <-> 5 <-> 3 <-> 6
...
...
remove(2): 4 <-> 1 <-> 5 <-> 3 <-> 6
containNodeWithValues(5): true
```
