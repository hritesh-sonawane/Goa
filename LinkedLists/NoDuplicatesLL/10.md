# Remove Duplicates From Linked List

Given the head of a Singly Linked List whose nodes are in sorted order with respect to their values.
**_Write a function that returns a modified version of the Linked List that doesn't contain any nodes with duplicate values._**
The Linked List should be modified in place(i.e., no need to create a brand new list), and the modified Linked List should still have its nodes sorted with respect to their values.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list or to `None`/`null` if it's the tail of the list.

Sample Input

```go
linkedList = 1 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 6
```

Sample Output

```go
1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 // head node with value 1
```
