# Remove Kth Node from End

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer `k` and removes the kth node from the end of the list.

The removal should be done in place, meaning that the original data structure should be mutated.

Furthermore, the input head of the linked list should remain the head of the linked list after the removal is done, even if the head is the node that's supposed to be removed. In other words, if the head is the node that's supposed to be removed, your function simply mutate its `value` and `next` pointer.

Your function doesn't need to return anything.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as `next` node pointing to the next node in the list or to `Node`/`null` if it's the tail of the list.

Sample Input

```go
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10
k = 4
```

Sample Output

```go
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10
```
