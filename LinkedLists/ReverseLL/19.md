# Reverse Linked List

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List, reverses the list in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new list), and returns its new head.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list or to `None`/`null` if it's the tail of the list.
Head will never be `None`/`null`.

Sample Input

```go
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 //head node w/ value 0
```

Sample Output

```go
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 //new head w/ value 5
```
