# Shift Linked List

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer number `k`, shifts te list in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new list) by k positions, and returns its new head.

Whether nodes are moved forward or backward is determined by wheteher `k` is positive or negative.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the next node in the list or to `None`/`null` if it's the tail of the list.'

Sample Input

```go
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5  // head node with val 0
k = 2
```

Sample Output

```go
4 -> 5 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3  // new head node with val 4
```
