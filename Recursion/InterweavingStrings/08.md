# Interweaving Strings

Write a function that takes in 3 strings and returns a boolean representing whether the third string can be formed by interweaving the first 2 strings.

To interweave strings means to merge them by altenating their letters without any specific pattern.
egs: `abc` and `123` can be interwoven as `a1b2c3`, `12ab3c`.

Letters within a string must maintain their relative ordering.

Sample Input

```go
one = "abc"
two = "def"
three = "abdecf"
```

Sample Output

```go
true
```
