# Lowest Common Manager

Given 3 inputs, all of which are instances of an `OrgChart` class that have a `directReports` property pointing to their direct reports. The first input is the top manager in an organizational chart (i.e.; the only instance that isn't anybody else's direct report), and the other 2 inputs are reports in the organizational chart. The 2 reports are guaranteed to be distinct.

Write a function that returns the lowest common manager to the 2 reports.

Sample Input

```go
{
  "topManager": "A",
  "reportOne": "E",
  "reportTwo": "I",
  "orgChart": {
    "nodes": [
      {"directReports": ["B", "C"], "id": "A", "name": "A"},
      {"directReports": ["D", "E"], "id": "B", "name": "B"},
      {"directReports": ["F", "G"], "id": "C", "name": "C"},
      {"directReports": ["H", "I"], "id": "D", "name": "D"},
      {"directReports": [], "id": "E", "name": "E"},
      {"directReports": [], "id": "F", "name": "F"},
      {"directReports": [], "id": "G", "name": "G"},
      {"directReports": [], "id": "H", "name": "H"},
      {"directReports": [], "id": "I", "name": "I"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Sample Output

```go
Node B
```
