# Product Sum

**_Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns its product sum._**

A "special" array is a non-empty array that contains either integers or other "special" arrays. The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its elements, where "special" arrays inside it are summed themselves and then multiplied by thier level of depth.

Sample Input

```go
array = [5, 2, [7, -1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]]
```

Sample Output

```go
12 // 5+2+2*(7-1)+3+2*(6+3*(-13+8)+4)
```
