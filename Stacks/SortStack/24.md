# Sort Stack

Write a function that takes in an array of integers representing a stack, recursively sorts the stack in place(i.e. doesn't create a new array), and returns it.

The array must be treated as a stack, with the end of the array as the top of the stack.
Therefore you're only allowed to:

- Pop elements from the top of the stack by removing elements from the end of the array using the built-in `.pop()` method.
- Push elements to the top of the stack by removing elements from the end of the array using the built-in `.append()` method.
- Peek at the elements on top of the stack by accessing the last element in the array.

Note: You're not allowed to perform any other operation on the input array, including accessing elements(except last element), moving elements, etc. You're also not allowed to use any other data structure, and the solution must be recursive.

Sample Input

```go
stack = [-5, 2, -2, 4, 3, 1]
```

Sample Output

```go
[-5, -2, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
