# Longest Common Subsequence

Write a function that takes in 2 strings and returns their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a set of characters that aren't necessarily adjacent in the string but that are in the same order as they appear in the string. For instance, the characters `["a", "b", "c", "d"]` form a subsequnece of the string `"abcd"`, and so do the characters `["b", "d"]`. Note that a single character in a string and the string itself are both valid subsequneces of the string.

You can assume that there will only be one longest common subsequence.

Sample Input

```go
str1 = "ZXWYZW"
str2 = "XKYKZPW"
```

Sample Output

```go
["X", "Y", "Z", "W"]
```
