# Pattern Matcher

Given 2 non-empty strings, the first one is a pattern consisting of only `"x"`s and/or `"y"`s; the other one is a normal string of alphanumeric characters. Write a function that checks whether the normal string matches the pattern.

Assume that there will never be more than one pair of strings `S1` and `S2` that appropriately represents `"x"` and `"y"` in the normal string.

Sample Input

```go
pattern = "xxyxxy"
string = "gogopowerrangersgogopowerrangers"
```

Sample Output

```go
["go", "powerrangers"]
```
