# Run-Length Encoding

Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and returns its run-length encoding.

"Run-Length Encoding" is a form of lossless data compression in which data is stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. egs: "AAABB" => "3A2B"
However, 12As => "9A3A"

Input string is guaranteed to be non-empty

Sample Input

```go
string = "AAAAAAAAAAAAABBCCCCDD"
```

Sample Output

```go
"9A4A2B4C2D"
```
