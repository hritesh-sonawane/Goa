# Valid IP Address

Given a string of length 12 or smaller, containing only digits. Write a function that returns all the possible IP addresses that can be created by inserting three `.`s in the string.

An IP address is a sequence of four positive integers that are separated by `.`s, where each individual integer is within the range `0-255`, inclusive.

An IP address isn't valid if any of the individual integers contains leading `0`s. For example, `"192.168.0.1"` is a valid IP address, but `"192.168.00.1"` and `"192.168.0.01"` are not, because they contain `"00"` and `"01"`, respectively. Another example of a valid IP address is `"99.1.1.10"`, and `"991.1.1.0"` is invalid because `991>255`

Your function should return the IP addresses in string format and in no particular order. If no IP address can be created, function should return an empty list.

Sample Input

```go
string = "1921680"
```

Sample Output

```go
[
    "1.9.216.80",
    "1.92.16.80",
    ...
    ...
    ...
    "192.16.8.0"
]
```
