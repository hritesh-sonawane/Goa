# Suffix Trie Constriction

Write a `SuffixTrie` class for a Suffix-Trie-like data structure. The class should habe a `root` property set to be the root node of the trie and should support:

- Creating the trie from a string, this will be done by calling the `populateSuffixTrieFrom` method upon class instantiation, which should populate the trie from the string `root` of the class.

- Searching for strings in the trie.

Note that every string added to the trie should end with the special `endSymbol` character: `*`

Sample Input (for creation)

```go
string = "babc"
```

Sample Output (for creation)

```go
{
    "c": {"*", true},
    "b": {
        "c": {"*", true},
        "a": {"b": {"c": {"*": true}}},
    },
    "a": {"b": {"c": {"*": true}}},
}
```

Sample Input (for searching in the suffix trie above)

```go
string = "abc"
```

Sample Output (for searching in the suffix trie above)

```go
true
```
